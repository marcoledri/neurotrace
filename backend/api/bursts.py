    Strategy: apply the same pre-detection filter the auto-detector used,
    then hand a tiny [time_s − 20 ms, time_s + 20 ms] seed window to
    ``_populate_burst_fields``. That helper finds the strongest
    deviation within the seed, sets the pre-burst baseline from the
    preceding ``pre_burst_window_ms``, and extends the bounds outward
    until the signal returns near the baseline — exactly what
    auto-detection does for every burst it finds.

    Returns a single burst dict in the same shape as
    ``BurstDetection.run().bursts[...]``, with an extra ``manual: true``
    flag so the frontend can style it distinctly.
