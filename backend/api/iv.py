"""I-V curve analysis — compute (stimulus level, response) pairs across every
sweep in a series so the frontend can plot the cell's I-V relationship.

For each sweep we return BOTH a steady-state response (mean of the last
``peak_window_ms`` of the pulse minus baseline) AND a transient peak response
(most-deviant sample in the pulse minus baseline). The frontend picks which
metric to display; both are always returned so switching doesn't require a
refetch.

Baseline is measured in the FIRST ``baseline_window_ms`` of the sweep — user
may override the window via the query params.
